# CompassElephantBundle ![Travis build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/matteosister/CompassElephantBundle.png)#

A Bundle to use the [CompassElephant](https://github.com/matteosister/CompassElephant) library in a Symfony2 project

This bundle scans your [compass projects](http://compass-style.org/) on every request, and checks if they needs to be recompiled. It takes care of dependencies, so you can use compass with **@import**, **sprite generation** etc. without problems. Let Symfony **watch** your project and forget about it.

Installation
------------

**composer (for symfony 2.1)**

Installing with composer is as simple as typing in the root of your symfony project

```
composer require cypresslab/compass-elephant-bundle:dev-master
```

**deps file (for symfony 2.0)**

Add the bundle and the CompassElephant library to the deps file inside the root of your symfony project

```
[compass-elephant]
    git=https://github.com/matteosister/CompassElephant.git

[CompassElephantBundle]
    git=https://github.com/matteosister/CompassElephantBundle.git
    target=bundles/Cypress/CompassElephantBundle
```

Autoload

*app/autoload.php*

``` php
<?php
$loader->registerNamespaces(array(
    // ... other namespaces ...
    'Cypress'          => __DIR__.'/../vendor/bundles',
    'CompassElephant'  => __DIR__.'/../vendor/compass-elephant/src'
));
```

Register the bundle
-------------------

Register the bundle in the **AppKernel.php** file inside the dev section

*app/AppKernel.php*

``` php
<?php
if (in_array($this->getEnvironment(), array('dev', 'test'))) {
    // ...other bundles ...
    $bundles[] = new Cypress\CompassElephantBundle\CypressCompassElephantBundle();
}
```

Configuration
-------------

**Add the configuration in your config file (for the dev environment)**

*app/config_dev.yml*

```
cypress_compass_elephant:
    compass_projects:
        my-nice-project:
            path: %kernel.root_dir%/../src/Cypress/DemoBundle/Resources/public/compass
```

*my-compass-project* is a random name for this example. Pick the name you want

*path* has to be an existing directory. By default, if the directory is empty, CompassElephant try to init a compass project

**be gentle with your server cpu: remove the listener on production as it's not needed. You will serve static css files**

*app/config_prod.yml*

```
cypress_compass_elephant:
    register_listener: false
```

*Important*

Remember that the apache user needs write access to the "sass" folder, the "stylesheet" folder and the config.rb file. If you use compass defaults you will have everything inside the same project folder. You can give permission to all files inside. But you can as well change the position of the stylesheets folder to be outside the project. CompassElephant parses the config file and uses it, just remember to set the right permissions on the folders you define inside compass config file.

**Add the stylesheets to your templates**

*assetic*

```
{% stylesheets filter="yui_css"
    "@CypressDemoBundle/Resources/public/compass/stylesheets/screen.css" %}
    <link href="{{ asset_url }}" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
{% endstylesheets %}
```

*without assetic*

```
<link href="{{ asset('bundles/cypressdemo/compass/stylesheets/screen.css') }}" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

Enjoy!

Complete configuration reference
--------------------------------

```
cypress_compass_elephant:
    register_listener: true
    compass_binary_path: "/usr/local/bin/compass"
    compass_projects:
        blog:
            path: %kernel.root_dir%/../src/Cypress/BlogBundle/Resources/public/compass
            staleness_checker: finder # or native
            config_file: config.rb
            auto_init: true
            target: sass/screen.scss
```

* *register_listener* whether to register the listener that compiles the project, if needed, on every request. **Turn this off in production** as you don't want to watch your scss files on every request...even if it take only 5-10 ms (be sure to upload the compiled css files during deploy)
* *compass_binary_path* is useful to force a binary that is not the default one that "which compass" gets.
* *compass_projects* is a collection of all the compass projects in your symfony project (maybe one for application)
* *staleness_checker* define what strategy the bundle use to define if a project is "clean" or needs recompile. "finder" is the default one, and you should use it. Read the [CompassElephant readme file](https://github.com/matteosister/CompassElephant) for more on this
* *config_file* is the name of te config file for compass. Defaults to config.rb, the standard one. You can use this setting to compile different stylesheets based on environment
* *auto_init* if set to false disable the init feature on an empty folder. Defaults to true
* *target* Tells CompassElephant to compile that single file, and not the whole compass project. The target should be **the relative path from the root of your compass project**

Command line
------------

There is a simple command to compile all compass projects. It's really useful for deploy procedures (capifony)

*for example, in a capifony deploy you could trigger this command*

```
./app/console cypress:compass:compile -e=prod
```

How it works
------------

This bundle register an event listener that, on every request, check if the projects defined in the config_dev.yml files are in "clean" state or needs recompile.

If the project does not need to be recompiled, it adds a really small overhead to symfony. At least with the finder staleness_checker option, just the time to check a bunch of files.

If you use native implementation it's really slow. So use it only if for some reason you can't use the finder component
